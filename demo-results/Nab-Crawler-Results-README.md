NAB Website Crawler - Basic Documentation
What I Did
Set up Norconex HTTP Collector v3.1.0 to crawl NAB's website (https://www.nab.com.au) with Elasticsearch integration.

Configuration:

Target: NAB business website
Crawler: Norconex v3.1.0 with working XML config
Search: Elasticsearch indexing enabled
Scope: Multi-domain crawling (external assets allowed)

Results:

63 files downloaded (5.25MB total)
15 documents indexed in Elasticsearch
Multi-domain content captured (NAB + external sites)

How I Confirmed Index Files Were Generated/Downloaded
Downloaded Content Verification
bash# Check download folder contents
Get-ChildItem -Recurse .\test-output\Fixed_32_NAB_32_Crawl\nab-fixed\downloads\
# Result: 63 files, 28 folders, 5.25MB

# Key content found:
# - d.https_www_nab_com_au/ (main NAB content)
# - f.about-us (463KB - substantial content)
# - External domains (Google, YouTube)
Elasticsearch Index Validation
bash# Confirm index exists and document count
curl "http://localhost:9200/nab_fixed/_count"
# Result: {"count":15}

# Test search functionality  
curl "http://localhost:9200/nab_fixed/_search?q=business&size=3"
# Result: 5 matching documents, 144KB+ response

# Export indexed content
curl "http://localhost:9200/nab_fixed/_search?size=15" > all-docs.json
# Result: 1.16MB of indexed content
How I Validated Scraped Information Suffices for Demo
Content Quality Assessment

Volume: 463KB about-us page = substantial business content
Diversity: 63 files across multiple domains shows crawler scope
Search Ready: 15 documents indexed with rich content (77KB average per doc)

Demo Requirements Met

Working Configuration: XML config successfully crawls enterprise website

Conclusion: Content volume, search functionality, and crawler capability are sufficient for demonstrating enterprise-grade web crawling solution.
