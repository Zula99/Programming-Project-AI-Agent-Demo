# SmartMirrorAgent TODO List

## Current Active Todos

### Update Todos
- [ ] Connect agent to existing crawl4ai implementations (crawl_nab.py)
- [ ] Integrate existing static mirror builder (build_static_mirror.py)
- [ ] Implement actual asset downloading in quality monitor
- [ ] Remove emojis from all code files per CLAUDE.md update
- [ ] Add robust error handling and failure recovery
- [ ] Test agent with real crawling on NAB website
- [ ] Optimize for speed targets (Recon <10s, Crawl 5-30min)
- [ ] Create FastAPI wrapper for Node frontend integration
- [ ] Add OpenSearch integration for content indexing
- [ ] Implement real-time progress tracking for frontend

## Priority Breakdown

### Priority 1: Core Functionality (Make it work)

1. **Connect agent to existing crawl4ai implementations** - Replace placeholder crawling functions with actual crawl_nab.py integration
2. **Integrate existing static mirror builder** - Connect build_static_mirror.py to the agent's mirror building phase
3. **Implement actual asset downloading** - Replace placeholder asset counting with real file downloads   
4. **Remove emojis from all code files** - Clean up code per updated CLAUDE.md requirements

### Priority 2: Testing & Validation

5. **Add robust error handling and failure recovery** - Handle crawling failures, timeouts, and edge cases gracefully
6. **Test agent with real crawling on NAB website** - Validate 90% success rate target with actual site   
7. **Optimize for speed targets** - Ensure Recon <10s, Full crawl 5-30min, Mirror <5min

### Priority 3: Integration Ready

8. **Create FastAPI wrapper for Node frontend integration** - API endpoints for "scrape example.com" commands
9. **Add OpenSearch integration for content indexing** - Enable search capabilities across crawled content
10. **Implement real-time progress tracking** - WebSocket/SSE updates for frontend progress bars

## Timeline

The todo list prioritizes getting the agent functionally working first (connecting existing implementations), then testing and validation to hit the 90% success rate, and finally frontend integration readiness.

### Key Focus Areas:
- **Week 1 Target**: Items 1-6 (Core functionality + testing)
- **Week 2 Target**: Items 7-10 (Optimization + integration)
- **90% Success Rate**: Validated through item 6 with real NAB crawling

## Success Metrics
- 90% visual fidelity across all site types (JS-heavy and static)
- Superior search performance vs original sites through OpenSearch
- Comprehensive content coverage including dynamically rendered content
- Learning improvement - success rate increases over time with pattern recognition
- Speed targets: Recon <10s, Strategy <5s, Full crawl 5-30min, Mirror <5min
